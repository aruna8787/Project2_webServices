# Project2_webServices
objective of this project is to design and implement a conversation handler for coordination protocols. It has been designed and implemented as a restful webservice that can read coordination protocol from an xml file and parse it and according to protocol, conversation handler webservice will handle communication between webservices and the user. All user requests will go through my conversation handler web service. So, it acts as a coordinator between webservices and the end user. Each user conversation will have unique conversation id and different users can start conversation at the same time.This project will have the following functionalities.
1.	A user interface to the user to invoke web services and get response.
2.	10 different restful webservices which will give response in json and xml.
3.	A conversation handler webservice which will handle communication between user and 10 web services based on coordination protocol.
